# Minecraft-Tools
Minecraft Tools for all Minecraft versions made in C#. It has dozens of unique tools! Supports up to MC 1.15.2.

The new change log can be started by pressing Ctrl+L on the main window. And this repository includes a precompiled executable.

* EDIT: to save several hundreds of MB some of the bigger secret files were removed from the main application. So almost all features will still be fully working, but if you happen to want the missing secret files, then please download this big file from mediafire (please use some kind of pop-up blocker in your browser since mediafire is full of publicity), then extract it's contents in the same folder as the main executable in a way that the folder named "Secrets" inside the zip file ends up near your executable named "Minecraft Tools.exe", if done properly, when the secrets window is shown, then you should see that most of it's previously grayed buttons are now enabled, thisw means that all the files are now ready to work (please also add a folder named "Secrets" near the main executable if doesn't already exists and extract all the folders from the zip file inside it):

* EDIT: a file named "A24938DB" with 26.601 real Minecraft skins inside is missing from "Minecraft-Tools-master\Minecraft Tools\bin\Debug\Secrets\Skins\" because is over 25 MB (it's about 57 MB), so if you want to have it, now you can download it from here, but please add it manually to the path described above once you've downloaded the source code of this application and extracted it from it's zip file using the Secrets window (read the internal help for more info on how to show and enable the secret files by pressing F1):

Also if you just want 26.601 real Minecraft skins in a single zip file ready to use here is an old link:

Hello everyone my goal is to have an "all-in-one" free Minecraft tool, that could be used for anything Minecraft related. I have no intention to compete against others to see which one makes the best tool, but instead compete against myself to see how far I'll be able to develop it. I've never wanted any fame or money, I'm just looking for perfection in my creations, and to achieve this I knew I had to release it's source code to be able to help the Minecraft community as well, and since several people asked me to publish my app here, now you'll also be able to collaborate with your own ideas to improve it even more, so feel free to download it and play with it's code. Thanks a lot for your attention! :-)

Some of it's main features include (outdated, now it has a lot more unique and cool tools, so please try it out):

- Pixel art generator with the highest quality available
- NBT viewer and editor (editor not yet implemented)
- Auto-backup system when using "write" features like the NBT editor on the selected worlds and related files
- 2D world viewer with dozens of maps
- 3D structure generator based on painting simple 2D images also creates mazes and other cool structures
- Banner and shield designer with image exporter even with it's recipes
- Slime chunks finder based on text or numeric seeds
- World seed infinite calculator (literally!), I generated my own GetHash() based on as string, which supports infinite bits
- Painted structures exporter (WIP), like the 3D structure will use simple 2D images and will export a sequence in 2D
- Thumbnail generator and avergae color finder for any image, useful for new textures or resizing images
- Finder of differences between Minecraft .JAR versions, will find what files have changed after a new update to save time
- Redstone designer that will export to new Minecraft worlds, not yet implemented
- Real time Minecraft world clock, shows several hard to find info about the time and weather and it's also very fun
- Block info viewer, kind of a mini block wiki offline, currently unfinished
- Automatic skin downloader, if you find a server with skins, you might get thousands of them automatically without being kicked
- Note blocks tuner, in the future will record sound and tell you on which note (and maybe instrument?) it's tuned
- Villager tradings viewer, kind of a little help offline like a mini wiki
- Entities info viewer, like the villagers info about all the entities, like damage dealt on all difficulties
- Resource structure rebuilder, copies all the sounds, etc from Minecraft with their original names on your desktop
- Paintings viewer, contains the original Minecraft paintings and also all the info about them, even with effects and filters
- Enchantment names viewer, converts text to the Standard Galactic Alphabet and vice-versa also emulates the enchanting table
- Secrets, like all the Xbox 360 resource packs and skins for PC (converted by myself, and 100 % without errors), etc
- And a lot of other planned tools in the near future, so please stay tuned for more...

It also contains a bit of publicity in it's menu, with links to the free music albums made by myself (Júpiter Mauro Cámara),
and some friends of mine, David Maeso and Fratelli Stellari. Finally it also includes an internal wiki about the Hermitcraft server and it's members.

Anyone is more than welcome to collaborate in this project and make it more perfect and bigger. I'm opened to listen any suggestion, although some things are difficult to make, so maybe you're the one that can help to improve it or add new features to it.

Also feel free to use any part of it's code in your own project, but please remember to give credit to me as the original author.

Note: the application shows English it's language, but internally is programmed in Spanish, which is where I'm from.

Thanks a lot for all your help and have a great day! ;-)
